# Chord-Identification-App

This medium-scale Python project is designed to allow users to analyze chords and eventually chord progressions according to 20th-century voice leading rules. This project is still in development with daily or bi-daily updates until completion. The VexFlow music notation rendering API is being used to draw chords and progressions in the browser: https://www.vexflow.com

The project is currently divided into a CLI folder and a Flask web-proect folder. The Flask project folder can be used to test the program by running flask run within the directory after installing the dependencies found in the 'requirements.txt' file. 

Tests for the chord identification functionality can be found in the tests/ folder within the CLI sub-directory.
